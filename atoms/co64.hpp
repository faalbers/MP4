/*
CHUNK OFFSET ATOM:
Chunk offset atoms identify the location of each chunk of data in the mediaâ€™s data stream.
The chunk-offset table gives the index of each chunk into the containing file.
There are two variants, permitting the use of 32-bit (co64) or 64-bit (co64) offsets.
The latter is useful when managing very large movies.
Only one of these variants occurs in any single instance of a sample table atom.
Note that offsets are file offsets, not the offset into any atom within the file (for example, a 'mdat' atom).
This permits referring to media data in files without any atom structure.
However, be careful whenructing a self-contained QuickTime file with its metadata (movie atom)
at the front because the size of the movie atom affects the chunk offsets to the media data.
