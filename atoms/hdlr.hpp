/*
HANDLER REFERENCE ATOM:
The handler reference atom specifies the media handler component that is to be used to
interpret the media’s data.
Historically, the handler reference atom was also used for data references.
However, this use is no longer current and may now be safely ignored.
The handler atom within a media atom declares the process by which the media data in
the stream may be presented, and thus, the nature of the media in a stream.
For example, a video handler would handle a video track.
